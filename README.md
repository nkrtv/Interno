## HTML Template Repository with HTML Proofer

This template repository includes a preconfigured GitHub Action that validates HTML files with [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/).
Validation is performed with dynamic pre-rendering of HTML files, allowing construction with JavaScript on-the-fly.
HTML files with the 'partial.html' suffix are ignored, making the validator compatible with dynamic construction of websites using HTML includes like [HTML Data Include](https://github.com/programmingmentor/html-data-include).
